 ### Inclusive Recruitment
[Our aim](https://github.com/uk-x-gov-software-community/community-space/blob/main/special-interest-meetings/inclusive-recruitment/2023-08-09.md#1-goal) [Link Available to Community members] is to increase the diversity of software engineers and other technical disciplines across government. We plan to do this by creating resources to support the development of more inclusive hiring practices, advocating and signposting people to these good practices and building a community where people can share ideas and discuss improving practices.

*Contact:* Eleanor Deal (eleanor.deal@ons.gov.uk or on x-gov Slack)

*Meetings:* Every 4-6 weeks, for 1 hour. We will review progress on creating resources, prioritise what resources to create next, and leave space to discuss ongoing recruitment campaigns if people want feedback on their own processes or job ads

### Open Source Software


*Aim:* To bring together practitioners from across government who are working to promote open source development in their organisations. The group meets to discuss and share issues, tools and blockers relating to open source (and inner source) development. The goal is to develop shared best practices and approaches to doing open source in a government context and to drive adoption across HMG.

*Contact:* jim17197@gchq.gov.uk, alex.smith@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk 

*Meetings:* Every four weeks on a Friday
